# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

## Planning
1. **Theme:** How would one design a social media app for traveling industry professionals (travel nurses, interns, college students, seasonal employees/contractors, full-timers, etc). Could their needs be better met than they currently are by platforms like Linkedin, Facebook, etc?
2. **Who & why:** Graduate (master's/PhD) students, contractors, tech interns, full-time employees, travel nurses, consultants. Users of 0-1 vs. many social media platforms, internship vs. permanent position, tech vs. other industries, MIT vs. non-MIT
3. **Questions & conversation starters:**
   - Tell me about yourself. 
   - Tell me about your past work/internship experience. 
   - Do you use any social media platforms? Which ones? 
   - How do you make new professional connections? 
   - Describe a time you used social media for professional networking purposes. 
   - Ever had a roommate? 
     - Followup: How did you find that roommate? 
   - Describe a recent roommate experience. 
   - How do you use social media to do your job, if at all? 
   - Compare the way you use social media for work/professional purposes to the way you use it regularly. 
   - Have you ever had to travel for work? 
   - Describe a time you needed to relocate for work. 
     - Followup: How did you like that experience? What could've made it better? 
   - Do you use social media when you're traveling for work (if applicable)? How? 
   - How do you find friends that share your interests outside of work? 
   - What do you consider most important when traveling/relocating for work? 
     - Followup: How do you ensure those important needs are met? 
   - Choose a social media app you've used for work/work travel. Walk me through how you'd use it.

## Interview 1: Anthony Smith Jr.

#### Summary
Anthony Smith Jr. is a business strategy consultant, born and raised in North Carolina. As a longtime lover of sneakers and popular culture, he initially attended university to study fashion design. It was at this point that Anthony realized he was more interested in the marketing side of the fashion industry, as opposed to design. He’d go on to pursue a degree in marketing and business administration from UNC at Greensboro, which he completed in 2013. His love for fashion culture and desire to pursue marketing at a high level inspired him to take a leap of faith in 2015, moving across the country to the San Francisco Bay Area where he now resides. In his own words, Anthony left home with nothing but “two suitcases and a couple thousand dollars.” Luckily, he would strike gold and spend the next several years contracting at companies like Lenovo, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and now Apple, where we both worked this past summer.

Anthony attributes a great deal of his success in finding opportunities to Linkedin, a platform with the ability to put him in direct contact with marketing industry professionals. However, he recalls his transition to the Bay Area lifestyle being particularly challenging. “I went from the south, where cost of living was very low, to moving over to California with two suitcases and not many connections, where cost of living is like 3x what I’m used to.” To make ends meet, he’d rent rooms on Airbnb, where the entire house was often being rented out (per room) to different random tenants. For Anthony, this was a fairly new and slightly uncomfortable environment, although having roommates seemed to be another norm of the Bay. In retrospect, he would have much preferred living arrangements with individuals sharing some common ground with himself, whether that be his hometown, university, work industry, or interest in fashion.

#### Questions
- **Q: Tell me about yourself.**  
**A:** Born & raised in NC, currently lives in California. Love for fashion. Degree in marketing, business administration & fashion. Had to branch out for new opportunities in tech. Moved from NC to California in 2015. Got a contracting opportunity at Facebook, took a leap of faith. Studied consumer behavior behind fashion. Does consulting with small to medium size businesses.
- **Q: Tell me about your work experience/background.**  
**A:** Worked at Facebook (2 years), Instagram, Twitter, Apple. Worked as a digital marketer at social media companies in their early stages. Worked in business operations & marketing.
- **Q: How did your first opportunity at Facebook open up?**  
**A:** Initial opportunity at FB opened up through lots of networking. Linkedin was a huge contributor, definitely kick-started his career and allowed him to reach out directly to people he wanted to get in contact with.
- **Q: How did you navigate relocating from North Carolina to California?**  
**A:** Experience was very different, huge increase in cost of living. Took a few years to adjust & get comfortable with the change. First experience of California was a trip to LA, learned that LA/California was the place to be for his interests (marketing/fashion).
- **Q: What new perspectives did you gain as a digital marketer in the social media space?**  
**A:** Switched from a consumerist to business standpoint. Sees the entire operation differently, companies know a lot about you from a data standpoint. Can be leveraged in various different ways that people don’t consider. Used to see social media platforms as all the same, now sees the difference between them. Every platform is designed differently, internally structured differently, and trying to achieve different goals. More appreciative of the different marketing styles and philosophies behind them. Having to use social media platforms in past roles/projects gave him a deeper understanding of the platform.
- **Q: Have you ever had a roommate experience?**  
**A:** Yes, had enough cash to book an Airbnb for a week. Had no connections in California. Booked a room in a home in SJ, the owner was a superhost renting out multiple rooms in a house. Was uncomfortable rooming with people he didn’t know, didn’t realize how common this was in the Bay Area. Wish there was something similar to Airbnb where you could find like-minded people from the same place, industry, also from North Carolina, same or similar colleges, etc. If there was a way to network/connect with people interested in the same thing, that would be cool.
- **Q: How’d you meet new people outside of work?**  
**A:** Was hard initially upon moving to CA. Going to gyms, connecting with people that hoop. Met people from work, connected with people based on his story, interests in fashion. Part of a fraternity (Kappa Alpha Psi), reached out to fraternity brothers. Started putting himself out there, stepped outside of his comfort zone and forced himself to grow his network. Met a friend from Bali that shared his interest in sneakers, met that person’s friends and found camaraderie.
