## Potential Features

|    |                 Name                  |                                                                                                                                                  Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|----|:-------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 1  | User-created professional communities |                                                            Users will have the ability to create and/or join custom work/school-based communities. They'll have the option to list them publicly, or privately with invite/request only privileges.                                                            |
| 2  |             Roommate pods             | Allow users to create roommate pods that want to secure housing in the same area, work from the same office, etc. These groups will be plotted on a map that is viewable by the entire community. Pods remain "open" for others to request to join until they either reach capacity or the creator closes it.  |
| 3  |           Roommate requests           |                                               Users could also directly request one another to be roommates. It would function similar to a friend request seen on many other apps, with a user's info and living preferences being prefilled into the request.                                                |
| 4  |          Roommate contracts           |                                 Once users have finalized a living group, they can collaborate on personalized living contracts from within the app. They can define things like quiet hours, rent responsibility, and guest policies, then save it for reference at anytime.                                  |
| 5  |            Roommate finder            |                                                    Swipe through potential roommates in a Tinder-swipe fashion. Quickly view their living preferences and roommate profile, then send a direct roommate request by swiping right if you like what you see.                                                     |
| 6  |     Work community announcements      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 7  |        Community event locator        |                              Users can post events they're hosting to the entire community. They can tag events with locations, allowing users to view all active events in a map view. Could potentially toggle between viewing roommate groups and events on the community map.                              |
| 8  |          Community bargains           |                                                                Sell used items at reduced prices to other work travelers in the community. Optionally tag them with a pickup location for community members to also view item sales on the map.                                                                |
| 9  | Personalized roommate recommendations |                                                       Generate a customized list of recommended roommates for users that still need a living group, similar to a Spotify daily mix. Users can be fed these suggestions once a day upon opening the app.                                                        |
| 10 |    AI-generated roommate summaries    |                                       Reaching out to new people can be scary. While exploring potential roommates, making a roommate request will prompt the AI to summarize info from both user profiles, and write a personalized message to include in the request.                                        |
| 11 |             Roommate swap             | Dissatisfied with your current living group? Offer yourself or a roommate up for a swap. Swap requests will include info about the housing arrangement, other roommates, and any other important details in a view similar to that of a Depop offer. Swaps must be confirmed by both parties before finalized. |
| 12 |      Collaborative grocery lists      |              Groups of roommates can collaborate on shopping lists of necessities for their shared living space, in a format similar to a collaborative iPhone note. Group members can check purchased items off the list, notifying the rest of the group that those items have been purchased.               |
| 13 |           Community trades            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 14 |        Roommate profile boosts        |                                                    Need to finalize your roommate arrangement in a short period of time? With enough in-app currency/points, temporarily boost your roommate profile visibility to others within the recommendation system.                                                    |
| 15 |   Community insider housing reviews   |            Give users the ability to leave ratings, suggestions, and warnings of specific landlords, apartment complexes, or rental sites. Travelers could then search this page for places they may be considering, and get a heads up from verified work travelers that have lived there before.             |
| 16 |           Affinity filters            |                                  Allow tagging of communities, events, roommate pods, and user profiles with different affinities. Users can then filter their search for roommates, professional communities, or local activities by the affinity groups they identify with.                                  |
| 17 |      Roommate bonding activities      |                        Have an AI agent scan the profiles & interests of roommate groups, then suggest fun activities for them to partake in together. Could integrate calendar data and work hours from all participants, and directly schedule events at optimal times for everyone.                         |
| 18 |           Chore scheduling            |     Allow living groups to create lists of chores. Can include a calendar view for assigning individual group members to chores at certain time slots. Could have deadlines for when specific chores must be completed, or an auto-scheduler that takes user preferences and assigns chores automatically.     |
| 19 |        Gentle roommate nudges         |                                                                       No one likes confrontation. Have an ability to politely "nudge" your roommates about chores, roommate contract violations, or other concerns from within the app.                                                                        |
| 20 |       Connection currency (CC)        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
