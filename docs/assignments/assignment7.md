## Draft impact case 

1. **The Problem: Financial Equality and Access to Loans**   
Financial equality and access to loans are critical issues that impact many individuals, especially those in underserved communities with limited access to traditional banking. Furthermore, traditional banking institutions often exclude individuals who lack significant credit history, or possess opposing cultural and religious beliefs. In many parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the Rotational Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) model has long provided these groups an alternative way to build savings and credit through communal effort. However, current implementations are still quite primal, completely reliant on trust and interpersonal relationships to function effectively. These approaches are often limited in scale, accessibility, and efficiency.

2. **The Solution: Digital-ROSCA**   
Our team proposes a solution to digitize ROSCA through a web application that maintains the essence of community-driven savings, while leveraging modern technology for broader reach and operational ease. Our platform will: enable secure digital payments and contributions to the savings pot; automate cycle rotations and group management; build trust through user verification and reliability evaluations; and offer educational resources supporting financial literacy.

3. **Why Digital-ROSCA is an Effective Solution**   
Digital-ROSCA addresses key limitations of the traditional model:
   - **Accessibility:** Internet technology opens participation to more people, including those in remote or rural areas.
   - **Financial Inclusion:** The system supports those with limited or no access to traditional loans due to a lack of credit history.
   - **Transparency and Security:** The platform’s secure payment systems and detailed transaction records mitigate risks associated with manual handling.
   - **Scalability:** Digital-ROSCA can reach a larger pool of participants, expanding the impact beyond localized communities.
   - **Cultural Relevance:** Digitizing a familiar model ensures that target communities accept and adopt the solution more easily.

4. **Measuring Impact**   
To prove Digital-ROSCA’s efficacy in promoting financial equality and loan access, we will measure:
   - **Financial Accessibility Metrics:** Track the number of participants who gain access to a savings and loan structure without needing formal banking.
   - **User Trust and Reliability Scores:** Analyze data on how reputation systems influence group participation and trust.
   - **Loan Provision Success Rates:** Evaluate the frequency and timeliness of payouts and early withdrawal requests.
   - **Adoption and Participation:** Monitor user growth, engagement levels, and geographic reach over time.

## Interview summaries
**One interviewee**, an experienced organizer of traditional ROSCAs (Equbs), shared a nuanced perspective on the processes, challenges, and social dynamics involved in managing communal savings groups. While digitization has significant potential to enhance efficiency and accessibility, retaining the trust, cultural values, and community focus at the core of ROSCA is crucial. Any digital solution must prioritize these elements, creating a balanced platform that preserves the spirit of ROSCA while embracing the efficiencies of technology.

The digitization of ROSCAs presents opportunities to enhance efficiency and accessibility through digital payments and communication platforms. However, as highlighted by Ashish Kumar Sedai's research, it's crucial to preserve the social bonds, trust, and cultural significance that make ROSCAs powerful tools for financial inclusion and women's empowerment. The key lies in using technology to strengthen, not replace, the human connections and community support that have made these groups successful, particularly in traditional societies.

Wilhem Hector is a current senior in the MIT class of 2025, born and raised in Haiti. Having come from humble beginnings in a country riddled with poverty and gang violence, Hector is quite familiar with ROSCA, also known as Sol in his country. His own parents are frequent beneficiaries of the model, often joining circles to replenish their own trades or put food on the table. In his experience, all financial dealings of a ROSCA are handled physically, with no technology whatsoever. While he acknowledges the cultural significance of Sol to most Haitians, Hector would never join a circle himself due to concerns over trustworthiness and reliability.


## Value-sensitive design 
ROSCA systems are typically practiced in low-income, developing nations that already have limited access to smartphones, digital technology, and banking institutions. Thus, the necessity of online bank accounts and smartphones could potentially exclude a segment of these stakeholders from participation in a digital ROSCA. Such groups are far less likely to switch from existing solutions, leaving us to target developing nations with some access to tech.  

There is a huge social component to traditional ROSCA systems. Circles are typically formed between community members, and trusted members of the neighborhood are usually the organizers. Digitizing this system could undermine the community-building aspect that comes with in-person ROSCA circles, which is quite central to the cultures that practice them. However, many members of traditional savings circles are accustomed to collecting their funds immediately, sometimes to expense time-sensitive, short-term events. Introducing bank transfers and wait times could potentially encourage more planned spending and financial growth.

Over time, the digitization of ROSCA systems could prompt user concerns around security, privacy, and trustworthiness. Not only are digital systems at greater risk of attack or technical failure, but they are more likely to fall victim to government regulation. This could further skepticism by stakeholders that already distrust formal institutions and corruption in government. Furthermore, online platforms simply can’t offer the same levels of trust and familiarity as community members.

Due to ROSCA’s pervasiveness in developing countries, other nations with formal banking institutions and greater financial literacy may have less of a use case for the platform. Thus, our app may struggle to gain traction in countries where individual savings accounts are common and preferred.

Nefarious actors could game the platform by joining circles, contributing until it’s their turn to receive the pot, then going inactive. This could ruin other users’ experience of the platform, and hurt them financially. We’d probably want some safeguards in place that bar noncontributors from joining future rotations, and prevent users from quitting early.
