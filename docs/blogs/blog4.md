# Response: Ubisoft A/B Testing

Tony’s summary of a purchase page redesign at Ubisoft Entertainment struck me as a compelling example of A/B testing gone right. I was able to clearly understand the motivations and hypothesis behind the A/B test, which were the conclusions drawn from user data and conversion rates. I was also made aware of external circumstances surrounding the test that would have affected results, like the holiday weekend timing. At the end, Tony included reputable statistics that quantified how useful the A/B test truly was to lead generation rates at Ubisoft. All of this information helped me recontextualize A/B tests as a strategy that can be used at any stage of a project when making measurable, concentrated changes.

It seems as though Ubisoft’s A/B tests were external facing, with the new page layout being deployed to potential customers. However, it’s also quite common for A/B tests to be done internally as well. Some software companies allow their teams to A/B test new changes before they’re even released to customers, essentially having employees double as beta testers. While this is something cool to do, I would imagine that having testers who are close to the product could negatively sway results due to bias or foresight. It could be more useful to conduct A/B tests in as neutral of an environment as possible, with people who may be interacting with your site for the first time. This constraint on the testers however, may limit the insights to being most useful in measuring things like impressions, clicks, and time spent on pages.

Although this was a solid read, I was left with a few questions that could have been explored deeper. What were the other A/B tests Ubisoft would go on to invest resources into? Were these tests equally as useful to their process, and what were the results? When and how long was the original A/B test conducted? Had they tried other user testing strategies before, and to what advantage?
