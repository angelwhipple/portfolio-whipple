Cameron, I enjoyed reading your assessment of the one-for-one business model, its pitfalls, and its advantages. You looked beyond the Toms example to illustrate good distinctions between addressing the symptoms and causes of a problem. I also appreciated your deeper analysis of the Wharton article mentioned during the lecture. Both the article and your blog post do a great job of weighing the benefits, and drawbacks of approaches taken by different one-for-one companies.

I ultimately agree with your stance, that there’s room for this model to prosper if companies are meaningfully addressing these humanitarian problems. I think that The Naked Hippie’s approach of donating proceeds to microloans for borrowers in Africa, Asia, and South America, then only profiting if loans are repaid, is a prime example of this. The company uses their influence to drive economic growth in stakeholder countries, taking adequate steps towards fundamental change rather than band aid solutions. They are also still able to generate shareholder value, but only secondarily and once the needs of stakeholders have been addressed.

What I did find interesting however, was your discussion of the psychology behind handouts and Warby Parker. Like yourself, I also found Warby Parker’s approach of “fostering self esteem” through paid handouts to be somewhat paradoxical. At the least, it feels like a way to convert even the beneficiaries of said charity to consumers. Like with the Toms model, the charge for eyeglass donations seems to address a strawman problem, with a solution that Warby Parker conveniently profits from in the end.

Something I would have liked to see you expand in your analysis, was the discussion of donations and dependency. Judging from your post, it seems like your standpoint is that donation-driven one-for-one models can only create a negative dependency among stakeholders. However, I’d argue that there are some cases in which donations are beneficial, appreciated, and give recipients a needed boost. The Wharton article mentions some good examples of this, like free vaccines, housing, and food resources. I would ask, can you think of any one-time donations a company can make that wouldn’t create these harmful dependencies? And since a lot of one-for-one companies only place band-aids on symptoms to begin with, would it really create that much of a resource gap if they withdrew their contributions tomorrow?
