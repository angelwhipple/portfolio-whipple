Ben and Nisha, I enjoyed reading your constructive back and forth about ideas for PlantIt, which I agree could be a great way to motivate productive group work. I agree with you both that students in particular could make a great target audience for this app, since many strong solutions for project management already exist in the corporate world. I’m just a bit curious as to what project management features will set your app apart from its counterparts in this space? Similarly, many users will have a preference for one tool over another based on the nature of the project, e.g. Github for coding, Asana for non-coding projects. Is there a particular genre of project that your app will aim to improve management for? I think clearly defining this, in addition to narrowing down your audience to students, will leave you with plenty of room to set your app apart with some novelty.

There is one area that I think goes quite unnoticed by existing solutions, which is team accountability and consistency. While I’ve seen some great platform features for simply managing, displaying, and organizing group work, there are few concepts that meaningfully tackle issues like unequal participation or inconsistent progress. In this respect, I think your idea of a hub that tracks everyone’s progress could be a good visual representation of overall contributions/effort across a team. Aside from serving as a visual motivator to convince others to do their fair share, there could also be some way of gently nudging one another to complete tasks, or even requesting assistance and redistributing the work between one’s teammates.

While I agree with Nisha that financial incentives are great motivators, I completely understand Ben’s perspective that the time and resources available for this project could complicate the process of introducing paid rewards into this web app. On the same note, the digital garden and plant rewards could be a cute addition that encourages continued progress. I think gamifying completion this way could be effective, and it reminds me of many mobile games where the addictiveness comes from nourishing some virtual world and seeing it grow over time. Perhaps including some notion of work streaks with greater digital rewards would be a nice addition that encourages consistent progress.

Overall, I like the enthusiasm your team seems to have for this idea, and I’m looking forward to seeing how PlantIt turns out.
